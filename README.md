# 🎮 Neon Tic Tac Toe

This is a **Tic Tac Toe** game with a neon aesthetic, developed in **Python** using **Pygame**. It's a nostalgic look back at one of my first milestones in programming—my **second project**. This project helped me learn about game development, graphics handling, and user interaction.

## 📝 Features

- **Neon-Themed Design**: Custom X and O images with a glowing neon aesthetic.  
- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Play against a friend in an interactive grid.  
- **Dynamic Status Display**: Shows whose turn it is or the winner in real time.  
- **Winning Highlights**: Draws bold neon lines to show the winning row, column, or diagonal.  
- **Automatic Reset**: The game resets itself after a short pause when there's a winner or a draw.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DNSINED/TIC_TAC_TOE.git
   cd TIC_TAC_TOE
   ```
2. **Install Pygame** (if not already installed):  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. **Run the game**:  
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```
4. **Enjoy**: Click on the grid to place your X or O and compete against a friend!

## 📂 Files and Assets

- **`tic_tac_toe.py`**: The main game logic and execution.  
- **`x_o_startup.png`**: Startup splash screen with a neon theme.  
- **`X_neon.png` and `O_neon.png`**: Neon-style assets for X and O.  

Ensure these assets are in the same directory as the Python script for the game to work.

## 🔍 Concepts Practiced

- **Event-driven programming**: Handling user inputs and game events.  
- **2D Graphics with Pygame**: Drawing grids, shapes, and displaying images.  
- **Game logic**: Implementing turn-based play, win conditions, and resets.  
- **State management**: Keeping track of turns, the board state, and game status.

## ✨ Reflections

This project was a stepping stone in my programming journey. It helped me bridge the gap between basic scripting and interactive applications. While simple by design, it was instrumental in building my confidence as a developer.

If you're just starting out, creating small games like this is an excellent way to practice coding fundamentals while having fun!
